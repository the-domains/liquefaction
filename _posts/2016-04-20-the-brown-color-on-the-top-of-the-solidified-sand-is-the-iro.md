description: 'The brown color on the top of the solidified sand is the iron in the sand rusting, there will also be an element of mold but you see in the right hand corner there is a mound of brown dirt. This is very significant that there has been a large volume of water under this house for some time because the brown is actually 80% crystallized heavy metals. This particular house is an exception for heavy metals because of it showing on the smooth settled silt and sand.'
